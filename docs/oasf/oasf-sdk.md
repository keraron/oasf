# OASF SDK

The OASF SDK provides three services for working with OASF records:

* Validation: Validate OASF records against schema specifications.
* Translation: Convert OASF records to different formats (GitHub Copilot MCP, A2A).
* Decoding: Convert between JSON, Go structs, and Protocol Buffer structures.

The proto files can be found [here](https://buf.build/agntcy/oasf-sdk).
